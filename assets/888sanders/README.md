# Trial NFT Image Submission

I've created some images today for potential inclusion in the $WANKR War NFT collection and would greatly appreciate constructive criticism. 

Are these aligning well with the project's guidelines? 

Please feel free to nitpick details like composition, alignment, visual language elements, and overall quality. 

Additionally, could you suggest appropriate rarity levels for each of the 3 I'm submitting (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary) to help gauge the expected standards? 

For further discussion or to share the images, you can message me on X at @888sanders
